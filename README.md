# 03-Text-adventure

I tried my best to make an interesting little test adventure using Python as an interactive iction game engine.
While I used Json files to store dictionaries which made up the majority of the game.

It ended up being more of an interactive story rather than a game since the player doesn't have any actual impact.
There are different patcchs to the end and extra information to be found but in the end the ending is never changed and there is no way to lose.
